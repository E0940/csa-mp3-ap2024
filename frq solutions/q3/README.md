# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about...
- Create a *isWordChain* method in the WordChecker class
  - Returns true if the elements in the *wordList* (except the first) contains the pervious one 
  - Returns false otherwise
- Create a *createList* method in the WordChecker class
  - Create a *ArrayList<String>*
  - Add Strings in the *wordList* that starts with *target* but *target* itself gets removed in the String
  - Returns the *ArrayList<String>*

## Struggles with this question...
- I did not remove the *target* in the returned *ArrayList<String>* in the *createList* method during the apcsa exam

## Prior experiences that helped...
- How to create a *ArrayList<String>* variable

## What I learned by doing this question...
- The use of substring with an if statement
